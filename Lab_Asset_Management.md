## Lab - Asset Management with Snipe-IT and Cybersecurity Framework

### **Objective**
You will gain hands-on experience with Snipe-IT by managing various aspects of IT assets, including creating assets,
implementing BYOD policies, managing consumables and accessories, changing device statuses, adding software as assets,
and using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's **Identify** function to manage organizational assets.

### **Assignment Instructions**

Perform all the **tasks** on your own. 

**Submission**

Canvas Submission will be as following: 
**Pairing with a Classmate**
- Pair up with another student in the class to present your work and learn from each other’s approaches.

**Show-and-Tell Presentation**
- You will present your Snipe-IT setup to your partner, highlighting key components:
  - Asset creation (e.g., two assets with different categories)
  - BYOD implementation and policies
  - Changes in asset statuses
  - License and consumable management
  - Custom user roles and permissions
  - Key findings from the reports (e.g., trends, stock management)
  - Asset auditing process and any discrepancies found
  - Checkout process and user management
  - Software as an asset creation and management
  - Mapping activities with CSF
**Feedback and Discussion**
- After presenting, provide feedback to your partner on:
  - Strengths of their approach.
  - Suggestions for improvement (e.g., asset categorization, report analysis, or permissions configuration).
- Discuss how the assets and configurations you created could apply to real-world IT asset management scenarios.

### Tasks

**Asset Creation and Management**
- **Create Assets**: 
  - Add at least **two assets in different categories** (e.g., “Laptops” and “Peripherals”) with realistic details like serial numbers, purchase dates, and warranties.
  - Assign assets to user profiles to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Change Asset Status**:
  - For each asset, change its status to reflect various states, such as “In Use,” “Available,” “Maintenance,” or “Retired.”
  - Document each status change with a note on why it was necessary (e.g., a device was retired due to age or moved to maintenance due to repair needs).

**Asset Management and Cybersecurity Risk**
- **Identify and Manage Assets**:
  - According to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s Identify (ID) function**, focus on the **Asset Management (ID.AM)** category. Ensure that all assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems) you create are identified and prioritized based on their importance to organizational objectives and cybersecurity risk strategy.
  - Create an asset inventory with both critical and non-critical assets, reflecting their importance in achieving business purposes.
  - Ensure the asset inventory is aligned with a risk management strategy.

**Accessories and Consumables Management**
- **Add Accessories**:
  - Create at least **two accessories** (e.g., “Laptop Charger,” “Wireless Mouse”) and associate them with corresponding assets.
  - Indicate which users can check out accessories and add any relevant notes (e.g., “Must be returned after each workday”).
- **Create Consumables**:
  - Create at least **two consumables** (e.g., “Printer Ink Cartridges,” “USB Cables”) and manage stock levels and reorder points.
  - Set reorder levels and document usage history, noting any frequently used consumables that may require additional stock.

**BYOD Policy Implementation**
- **Define BYOD**: In a short paragraph, define “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) and briefly discuss its benefits (e.g., flexibility, cost savings) and challenges (e.g., security, compatibility).
- **Create BYOD Assets**:
  - Add at least **two personal devices** to the system as BYOD assets (e.g., "Employee's Personal Laptop," "Employee's Smartphone").
  - Assign these BYOD assets to users, reflecting a realistic BYOD setup.
- **Set BYOD Permissions**:
  - Adjust permissions to restrict BYOD asset access appropriately (e.g., view-only access to sensitive company data).
- **Security Considerations**:
  - List a few key security measures that should accompany a BYOD policy (e.g., encryption, VPN requirements).

**User Creation and Permissions Configuration**
- **Create User Profiles**:
  - Set up user profiles with diverse roles (e.g., “IT Manager,” “Creative Designer”) and adjust each user’s permissions based on their role.
  - Provide a brief explanation of each permission setting, indicating why each user role requires specific access levels.

**License and Consumable Management**
- **Add Licenses and Consumables**:
  - Choose one or both options:
    - Create a **software license** (e.g., design software, cybersecurity software) and configure it with relevant restrictions.
    - Create **consumables** (e.g., batteries, cables) and manage stock levels and reorder points.

**Adding Software as an Asset**
- **Add Software as an Asset**:
  - Add at least **one software product** as an asset in the Snipe-IT system (e.g., “Microsoft Office 365,” “Adobe Photoshop”).
  - Include key information such as license type, purchase date, number of seats, and the user(s) to whom the software is assigned.
  - Set any relevant notes (e.g., “Valid until December 2025,” “Subscription renewal required annually”).
  - Track the software license and usage history within the system.

**Reporting and Data Analysis**
- **Generate Reports**:
  - Use Snipe-IT’s reporting feature to create reports that provide an overview of all assets by category, user assignment, and asset status.
  - Generate reports for license usage and consumable stock levels, noting reorder points and current stock.
- **Analyze Report Findings**:
  - Write a short analysis identifying trends (e.g., high usage of specific assets, licenses nearing their seat limit).
  - Suggest potential management actions (e.g., ordering more consumables, adding licenses, planning asset replacements).

**Audit an Asset**
- **Asset Auditing**:
  - Select at least **one asset** and perform an audit within Snipe-IT.
  - Ensure that the asset’s details (e.g., serial number, status, location, user assignment) match the physical asset.
  - If discrepancies are found, document them and adjust the system data accordingly.
  - Write a brief report on the auditing process, discussing any issues found during the audit and how they were resolved.

**Checkout an Asset**
- **Checkout Process**:
  - Select at least **one asset** (e.g., a laptop or peripheral) and check it out to a user.
  - Document the checkout process, including any relevant details such as the check-out date, expected return date, and user details.
  - After the checkout, update the asset status in the system to reflect that it is checked out.
