## Lab - Asset Management with Snipe-IT and Cybersecurity Framework

### **Objective**
You will gain hands-on experience with Snipe-IT (https://snipeitapp.com/demo) by managing various aspects of IT assets, including creating assets,
implementing BYOD policies, managing consumables and accessories, changing device statuses, adding software as assets,
and using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's **Identify** function to manage organizational assets.

### **Assignment Instructions**

Perform all the **tasks** on your own. 

**Submission**

Canvas Submission will be as following: 
**Pairing with a Classmate**
- Pair up with another student in the class to present your work and learn from each other’s approaches.

**Show-and-Tell Presentation**
- You will present your Snipe-IT setup to your partner, highlighting key components:
  - Asset creation (e.g., two assets with different categories)
  - Software as an asset creation and management
  - BYOD implementation and policies
  - Changes in asset statuses
  - License and consumable management
  - Custom user roles and permissions
  - Asset auditing process and any discrepancies found
  - Checkout process and user management
  - Mapping activities with CSF
**Feedback and Discussion**
- After presenting, provide feedback to your partner on:
  - Strengths of their approach.
  - Suggestions for improvement (e.g., asset categorization, report analysis, or permissions configuration).
- Discuss how the assets and configurations you created could apply to real-world IT asset management scenarios.

### Tasks

**Asset Creation and Management**
- **Create Assets**: 
  - Add at least **two assets in different categories** (e.g., “Laptops” and “Peripherals”) with realistic details like( serial numbers, models, status, location, image, and purchase dates and warranties, if applicable).
  - Assign assets to user profiles to simulate real-world scenarios.
  - Note the tag and serial number to serach your created asset easily.
- **Change Asset Status**:
  - For each asset, change its status to reflect various states, such as "Pending", "Ready to Deploy", "Archived" or  if applicable “In Use,” “Available,” “Maintenance,” or “Retired.”
  - Document each status change with a note on why it was necessary (e.g., a device was retired due to age or moved to maintenance due to repair needs).


**Adding Software as an Asset**
- **Add Software as an Asset**:
  - Add at least **one software product** as an asset in the Snipe-IT system (e.g., “Microsoft Office 365,” “Adobe Photoshop”).
  - Include key information such as license type, purchase date, number of seats, and the user(s) to whom the software is assigned.
  - Set any relevant notes (e.g., “Valid until December 2025,” “Subscription renewal required annually”).
  - Track the software license and usage history within the system.
    
**Accessories and Consumables Management**
- **Add Accessories**:
  - Create at least **two accessories** (e.g., “Laptop Charger,” “Wireless Mouse”) and associate them with corresponding assets.
  - Indicate which users can check out accessories and add any relevant notes (e.g., “Must be returned after each workday”).
- **Create Consumables**:
  - Create at least **two consumables** (e.g., “Printer Ink Cartridges,” “USB Cables”) and manage stock levels and reorder points.
  - Set reorder levels and document usage history, noting any frequently used consumables that may require additional stock.

**BYOD Policy Implementation**
- **Define BYOD**: In a short paragraph, define “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) and briefly discuss its benefits (e.g., flexibility, cost savings) and challenges (e.g., security, compatibility).
- **Create BYOD Assets**:
  - Add at least **two personal devices** to the system as BYOD assets (e.g., "Employee's Personal Laptop," "Employee's Smartphone").
  - Assign these BYOD assets to users, reflecting a realistic BYOD setup.
- **Set BYOD Permissions**:
  - Adjust permissions to restrict BYOD asset access appropriately (e.g., view-only access to sensitive company data).
- **Security Considerations**:
  - List a few key security measures that should accompany a BYOD policy (e.g., encryption, VPN requirements).

**User Creation and Permissions Configuration**
- **Create Users**:
  - Create users name starting with 2030_yourname and first letter of last name.
  - use a fake email ending with @2030.edu
  - Assign permissions to the user you have created.
  - If app permits, set up users with diverse roles (e.g., “IT Manager,” “Creative Designer”) and adjust each user’s permissions based on their role.

**License and Consumable Management**
- **Add Licenses and Consumables**:
  - Choose one or both options:
    - Create a **software license** (e.g., design software, cybersecurity software) and configure it with relevant restrictions.
    - Create **consumables** (e.g., batteries, cables) and manage stock levels and reorder points.
      
**Reporting and Data Analysis**
- **Generate Reports**:
  - Use Snipe-IT’s reporting feature to create reports that provide an overview of all assets by category, user assignment, and asset status.
  - Generate reports for license usage and consumable stock levels, noting reorder points and current stock.
- **Analyze Report Findings**:
  - Do you suggest potential management actions (e.g., ordering more consumables, adding licenses, planning asset replacements).

**Audit an Asset**
- **Asset Auditing**:
  - Select at least **one asset** and perform an audit within Snipe-IT.
  - Ensure that the asset’s details (e.g., serial number, status, location, user assignment) match the physical asset.
  - If discrepancies are found, document them and adjust the system data accordingly.
  - Write a brief report on the auditing process, discussing any issues found during the audit and how they were resolved.

**Checkout an Asset**
- **Checkout Process**:
  - Select at least **one asset** (e.g., a laptop or peripheral) and check it out to a user.
  - Document the checkout process, including any relevant details such as the check-out date, expected return date, and user details.
  - After the checkout, update the asset status in the system to reflect that it is checked out.
 
### Cybersecurity Framework Mapping
Map your activities with the CSF here: (https://csf.tools/reference/nist-cybersecurity-framework/v1-1/id/id-am/)
You are supposed perform a mapping for your activity on the subcategory under ID.AM category.
Do you think your asset management covered all the Asset Manegement sub categories?
Goto ID.AM-1, what are the related controls?
Visit CM-8 System Component Inventory SC, read teh control statements. Do you think the asset management tool is covering these statements? 
Explain which sub categories are not covered by the Asset Management Tool you have used.
For each sub category, you can navigate through the NIST 800-53 Security Controls and try undertanding  the control statements
